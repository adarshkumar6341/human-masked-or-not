Given the critical importance of face mask compliance in public health and safety, the proposed solution aims to offer a robust, real-time classification model using deep learning techniques. The project investigates various CNN architectures and optimizes the model for high accuracy and efficiency in deployment. Furthermore, techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and model fine-tuning are explored to enhance performance on real-world datasets, ensuring scalability and effectiveness in different environments."],"metadata":{"id":"nOKQhW6ubOti"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#**Reading data from the kaggle**"],"metadata":{"id":"8nLqvAUs25Xw"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# prompt: read kaggle datasets download -d belsonraja/face-mask-dataset-with-and-without-mask\n","\n","!pip install kaggle\n","\n","# Upload your kaggle.json file\n","from google.colab import files\n","files.upload()\n","\n","!mkdir -p ~/.kaggle\n","!cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/\n","!chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":326},"id":"5kFjoy5m22wN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1728813259151,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":20736,"user":{"displayName":"ADARSH Kumar","userId":"03061616914505773424"}},"outputId":"ce10593a-da44-498f-f92b-d814bace1cd3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Requirement already satisfied: kaggle in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (1.6.17)\n","Requirement already satisfied: six>=1.10 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from kaggle) (1.16.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: certifi>=2023.7.22 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from kaggle) (2024.8.30)\n","Requirement already satisfied: python-dateutil in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from kaggle) (2.8.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: requests in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from kaggle) (2.32.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: tqdm in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from kaggle) (4.66.5)\n","Requirement already satisfied: python-slugify in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from kaggle) (8.0.4)\n","Requirement already satisfied: urllib3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from kaggle) (2.2.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: bleach in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from kaggle) (6.1.0)\n","Requirement already satisfied: webencodings in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from bleach->kaggle) (0.5.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: text-unidecode>=1.3 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from python-slugify->kaggle) (1.3)\n","Requirement already satisfied: charset-normalizer<4,>=2 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->kaggle) (3.3.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: idna<4,>=2.5 in /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages (from requests->kaggle) (3.10)\n"]},{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":["<IPython.core.display.HTML object>"],"text/html":["\n","     <input type=\"file\" id=\"files-7431a483-01bb-4919-adf8-de569d58888d\" name=\"files[]\" multiple disabled\n","        style=\"border:none\" />\n","     <output id=\"result-7431a483-01bb-4919-adf8-de569d58888d\">\n","      Upload widget is only available when the cell has been executed in the\n","      current browser session.
